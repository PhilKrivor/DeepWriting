# Deep Writing

A project involving two LSTM Neural Networks to generate text based on numerous samples. Both character based and word based LSTMs are used.

## Training

Training is done on Kaggle using a GPU in order to speed up the training process. Any changes made to the Python files are either code quality improvement, or tuning the neural network.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Language used
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Open-source neural network platform
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - High-level API for Tensorflow

## Versioning
